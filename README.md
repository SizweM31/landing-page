# landing-page

This project showcases my skill progression in HTML and CSS. 
The main fobjective will be to create a responsive website landing page using Flexbox.
This project shows how I have progressed (since the Odin-Recipes project) in using HTML for structuring more complex webpages
and CSS for styling webpages that can grow or shrink depending on the screen size.
